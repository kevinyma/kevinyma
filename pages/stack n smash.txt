Fitshare

Fitshare aims to bridge the disconnect that too often happens between online and in-store shopping. 

People who have shopped online are probably familiar with the emotional journey of excitedly recieving a package in the mail only to be let down by the contents, whether because of poor fit or the item appearing differently than they thought.

A3WR

A3WR, the Asian and Asian American Welcome Reception is an annual event that brings various campus groups together to welcome new freshman and to celebrate solidarity. 

The challenge was to create a brand that would represent the event itself, the host--the Cornell Asian Pacific Islander Student Union (CAPSU), as well as the greater community of the school.

I wanted to create a solution that would capture the energy the event would manifest, and the enthusiam by which we were going to recieve new students. 

After exploring a few alternatives I settled on punchy, colorful isometric lettering. Small details would add a quirky touch to the design.
