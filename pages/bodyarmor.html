				<p class="paragraph">The first prototype was a scramble to get the core functionality down. It was released to our friends with 23 levels that we
				had placed in (supposedly) increasing difficulty. </p>
				<p>Prior to release we decided on which analytics we were going to log.
				These included: number players who finish each level, time spent on each level,
				time spent on each box face 
				 number of actions (key press=action) logged on each level, etc. 
				

				</p>

				</div>
				<div class="grid_6 omega">
					<p class="paragraph">A few hundred friends played the prototype (thank you Facebook). Having recorded thousands of values across different fields from our friends into a database,
					 we created a series of data visualizations to see where they were having the most trouble.
					An average time spent on each level is shown above.</p>
					<p>

					Surprise: generally, levels did get more difficult. 
					But, it was obvious the early levels were way too easy, and some levels were near impossible. We went back to the impossible levels 
					and looked at a combination of level-specific data and real people playing through the level, to find out where we went wrong.</p>

							A huge challenge that stuck with us throughout

							Collecting player analytics allowed us to we overlay heatmaps on all levels; red (warmer) signifies more time
							 spent on a face. In the level above, players were spending a disproportionate amount of time on the second face;
							  they weren't learning the new mechanics, despite our efforts to display them on various parts of the screen.
