				<p class="projecttitle">BOX!</p>
				<p class="projectsubtitle">PUZZLES AND FUN STUFF HEY</p>
				<p class="textbox">
					BOX! is a puzzle platformer game created in collaboration with Jeremy Cytryn, 
					<a href="http://renchusong.github.io/portfolio/">Renchu Song</a>, 
					<a href="http://nndiebold.tumblr.com/">Natalie Diebold</a>
					, Sam Chen, and Will Peck. 
					I was responsible for user experience and visual design (art and animation).
				</p>

				<img src="../img/box/pixelbg.jpg">

				<p class="textbox">BOX! tells the age-old story of a boy who gets stuck in a floating cube in the sky. Never mind how, it's uh, a metaphor. But before I talk about that I'm going to have to start from  the very beginning. </p>

				<img src="../img/box/likeso.jpg" width="350px" alt="idea">

				<p class="textbox">We had this idea that 2D object could travel across the edges of a cube such that it ends up on itâ€™s original face in a completely different orientation. This presented us with so many possibilities, and we tried to explore as many as we could.</p>
				
				<img src="../img/box/paperprototype.jpg" alt="paperprototype">

				<p class="textbox">
					We needed, first to see if the idea of moving across a cube face was feasible. 
					A paper prototype was used to gauge stuff.<br><br>

					Early on, we played with mechanics like spikes and player-created boxes. The spikes were eventually cut, because we wanted players to explore without fear. The boxes however, stayed: they added a layer of complexity in that the player could actively shape the level.<br><br>
					
					More interestingly, the paper prototype revealed that at larger level sizes, players began to lose sense of orientation and position within the box. 7*7 was determined to be a size small enough so that player could remember spatial configurations, yet large enough to allow for interesting, varied level design.
				</p>


			<img src="../img/box/leveldesign.gif">
			<p class="textbox">
				There was a huge push for level design early on. All team members ideated on sets of levels we could use at various points in the game. We didn't want to create a tutorial. Rather, we hoped to 
				teach the player how to play through playing.
			</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

					The flash game format allowed us to find out. It enabled us to
					quickly deploy to a series of flash game sites 
					(Newgrounds, Kongregate) with very large, existing userbases. 
					The analytics and player feedback we collected would drive changes in
					subsequent iterations.

				<p class="paragraph">The first prototype was a scramble to get the core functionality down. It was released to our friends with 23 levels that we
				had placed in (supposedly) increasing difficulty. </p>
				<p>Prior to release we decided on which analytics we were going to log.
				These included: number players who finish each level, time spent on each level,
				time spent on each box face 
				 number of actions (key press=action) logged on each level, etc. 
				

				</p>

				</div>
				<div class="grid_6 omega">
					<p class="paragraph">A few hundred friends played the prototype (thank you Facebook). Having recorded thousands of values across different fields from our friends into a database,
					 we created a series of data visualizations to see where they were having the most trouble.
					An average time spent on each level is shown above.</p>
					<p>

					Surprise: generally, levels did get more difficult. 
					But, it was obvious the early levels were way too easy, and some levels were near impossible. We went back to the impossible levels 
					and looked at a combination of level-specific data and real people playing through the level, to find out where we went wrong.</p>

							<div class="grid_6">
							<p>
							A huge challenge that stuck with us throughout 
							different prototypes was: what is the best way to teach a game mechanic. Game mechanics 
							are learned through repetition but what about the first time that mechanic is introduced?
							</p>
							</div>

							<div class="grid_6 omega">

							<p class="paragraph">In the above level, the player is 
							required to build a block to jump on after they fall in the small pit.</p> 
							<p class="paragraph">
							Collecting player analytics allowed us to we overlay heatmaps on all levels; red (warmer) signifies more time
							 spent on a face. In the level above, players were spending a disproportionate amount of time on the second face;
							  they weren't learning the new mechanics, despite our efforts to display them on various parts of the screen.

									<p>At this point we knew we had to seamlessly incorporate the 
									mechanism instructions into the gameplay. After exploring a few possible solutions, 
									I designed and implemented a series of text bubbles 
									that would appear when a player was confronted with a 
									challenge for the first time, or they took too long completing a challenge.</p>

							<div class="grid_6 omega">
									<p class="paragraph">Data collected from A/B testing revealed less time spent on each level, 
									and a smaller player fall off rate per level, when the thought bubbles
									 took the place of the control displays we had previously. </p>
